# Marvel-or-DC Repository
### About
This repository is for a mini-project for the course SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science & Artificial Intelligence). The debate between Marvel or DC and which is better, prompted some thoughts within us. Being big superheroe fans ourselves, we set out to explore more about the data taken from the [Superheroes NLP Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jonathanbesomi/superheroes-nlp-dataset?datasetId=633089&sortBy=voteCount).

### Problem Definition
To predict the universe of a hero, whether they are from Marvel or DC.

### Models Used
- Decision Tree
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)

### Key takeaways
- You can take advantage of the different writing styles in each hero's description to predict whether they are from Marvel or DC 
- NLP has a much higher classification accuracy than a decision tree with depth 4
- NLP also has a significantly lower false positive rate of 10% than compared to decision tree's 44%
- It is possible to predict the universe of a hero only with numerical statistics of that hero but with weak probability of prediction

### Valueable Learning Experiences
- Improving the credibility of our analysis by employing point estimation on the classification accuracy
- Finding the most optimal depth of a decision tree to prevent underfitting or overfitting
- Learning how to apply and utilize NLP which was not taught in labs was an incredible journey
- Obtaining outstanding results from a simplified NLP model only inspired us further to try out more advanced NLP model designs in the future!
